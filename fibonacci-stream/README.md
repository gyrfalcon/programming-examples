#Fibonacci Sequence Using Streams

This code example is inspired by an interview question that I have both asked when interviewing people and been asked
 when I've been interviewed. This version came about when I was trying to think of a unique way to answer the question.

Build this project by running './gradlew build' and then use the shell script appropriate to your platform to run the
 program.

**Future Improvements**
* Print numbers in the sequence less than a specified value.
* This implementation breaks when trying to print a number in the sequence past the 47th.
