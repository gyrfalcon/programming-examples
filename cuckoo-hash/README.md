# Cuckoo Hash Algorithm Using Map in Scala

This project implements the Cuckoo hashing algorithm ([Pagh/Rodler 2001](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.25.4189)) in Scala.

In this project I've used the cycle: red-commit-green-commit-refactor-commit so that git history can be examined to see how each individual step was written.
